little program to calculate a cache problem for my Computer Architecture class
Direct mapped cache with the total size = 8 words, block size = 4 words
An explanation of how the following 20 memory words will be mapped to the cache, if they are accessed in the order listed:
30, 31, 32, 33, 30, 31, 34, 35, 40, 41, 32, 30, 40, 41, 50, 43, 44, 40, 41, 31 
For each word access above, indicate:

    what memory block the word belongs to
    for direct mapped, what cache index the memory block will map to
    for set-associative, what cache set the memory block will map to
    whether the access is a hit or a miss
    if it is a hit, any re-arranging of the blocks in the cache that will be necessary to maintain the LRU in the correct position (noting where each cache block will end up)
    if it is a miss,
    which memory words will be loaded into the cache,
    what words will be overwritten (if any),
    any re-arranging of the blocks in the cache that will be necessary to maintain the LRU in the correct position

    Show the final cache contents after all words have been accessed.
    Give the cache hit rate for these 20 words.
